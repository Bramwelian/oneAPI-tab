oneAPI Community Forum Image SIG
================================

The Image SIG hosts discussions and presentations for fundamental
image processing routines for high-performance computing, engineering,
financial, and other applications.

This SIG discusses the oneAPI Image Processing Library (oneIPL),
currently in the planning and spec development stage. Its goal is to
become an extensive library of ready-to-use, highly optimized image
processing functions. As part of oneAPI, oneIPL is designed to allow
execution on various computational devices: CPUs, GPUs, and other
accelerators. The functionality is subdivided into several domains:
filers, geometry transformations, and color and type conversions.

Its royalty-free APIs help developers:

1. Use vectorization and SIMD (single instruction, multiple data)
   instructions on CPU and GPU.

2. Use CPU threading and GPU SIMT (single instruction, multiple
   threads).

3. Improve the performance of computation-intensive applications with
   pipelines involving image processing and other operations provided
   as DPC++ kernel or oneAPI libraries.

In addition to domain-specific functionality, the Image SIG may also
discuss overall design features like the execution model, memory
model, or error handling. At times, the open source oneIPL Interfaces
project, which implements the oneIPL specification, may also be
discussed.

The Image SIG is led by John Melonakos.
